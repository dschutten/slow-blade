{"name":"Slow-blade","tagline":"SlowBlade Game","body":"#Slow-Blad Camera Experiment#\r\nThis is the latest build of my experiments with developing the camera controller. I just jumped in and coded it in a way that made sense to me. My goal was to make the camera do  two things:\r\n1. Keep the Slow Blade and the Play visible onscreen at all times.\r\n2. Lead the player in the direction they're moving.\r\n\r\nI might end up making the camera leading customized to each level, based on the obstacles, but I'm hoping this generic leading will work. I'm gong to keep experimenting with this camera, and as always, any tips would be appreciated.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
